# Mute Incognito Tabs

Mute Incognito Tabs is a Chrome extension that automatically mutes all new private (incognito) tabs by default. This ensures a quieter browsing experience when opening private tabs.

> **Note**: This extension is inspired by and based on the original work by [cilenco](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/automute-incognito/egpmkeedlhphenpnjhlnlaohcmbmmccj). It was not updated to manifest v3, so I created this new extension.

## Features

- Automatically mutes all new incognito tabs.
- Quickly un-mute tabs using the `CTRL+M` keyboard shortcut.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

## Usage

1. Open a new incognito tab. It will be muted by default.
2. To un-mute, press `CTRL+M` while the tab is active.

## Permissions and Privacy

Requires permissions to run in incognito mode. This extension does not store or collect any data.
